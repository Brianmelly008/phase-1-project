Instructions : 
Step 1: Create Project Structure

    Create a new folder for your project.
    Inside the project folder, create the following files:
        index.html
        style.css (inside a 'css' folder)
        index.js (inside a 'js' folder)

Step 2: Write HTML Structure

    Open the index.html file in your text editor.
    Write the basic HTML structure including <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
    Inside the <body> tag, create the necessary elements such as navigation bar, containers, buttons, and any other elements you need for your application.

Step 3: Add CSS Styling

    Open the style.css file.
    Write CSS rules to style your HTML elements.
    Style the navigation bar, containers, buttons, background images, and any other components to achieve the desired appearance.

    Open the index.js file.
    Write JavaScript code to add interactivity to your web application.
    Implement functionality for fetching random images of dogs, retrieving dog facts, handling navigation, and any other dynamic features you want to include.

Step 5: Test Your Application

    Open the index.html file in a web browser to view your application.
    Test all the features and functionalities to ensure they work as expected.
    Use browser developer tools (usually accessible by pressing F12) to debug any issues and refine your code.

Step 6: Deploy Your Application (Optional)

    Once you're satisfied with your application, you can deploy it to a web hosting service to make it accessible online.
    Choose a web hosting provider and follow their instructions to upload your files and make your application live on the internet.

    Gather feedback from users and stakeholders.
    Continuously iterate on your application by adding new features, improving existing ones, and fixing any bugs or issues.

Step 8: Document Your Project

    Create documentation that outlines the features, functionalities, and usage instructions for your application.
